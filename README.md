RBS Utilities
-------------

A collection of utility methods and classes used for analyzing ribosome binding sites (RBS), both in publicly availabled datasets (Transterm and EMBL phage) and in our data collected by Roche 454 sequencing.

*Caveat:* For our purposes, RBS was defined as the 18 bases prior to the start codon. That assumption appears a handful of times throughout this code, so if you do use this for something, be careful.
